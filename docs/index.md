My plan for this week:

Hack 1: Work on early in the week, finish by Tuesday. Should be the easiest one to complete.

Hack 2: I haven't really been able to go over object references very much so I might need to research a little bit, however I think I'll be able to figure everything out and complete it by Wednesday or Thursday.

Hack 3: This one sounds kind of difficult to navigate but the actual plan seems simple, this means I'll have to work a little bit longer on this one but I'll figure it out by Friday, if not I'll finish it by the weekend.

# Linked Lists
Linked lists are a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

# Generic T
Can be used for any "type" and represents a generic class.

# Key Learnings (Calculator)
I learned about how stacks work using the java.util.Stack import, as well as various functions like the switch, pop, and peek functions.
```
while (tokenStack.peek() != null) {
            reverse_polish.add((String)tokenStack.pop());
        }
```
The code snippet above includes both the peek and pop functions. The peek function allows us to view the topmost value on the Stack and the pop allows us to take out a value from the stack and use it as a variable.
