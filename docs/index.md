My plan for this week:

Hack 1: Work on early in the week, finish by Tuesday. Should be the easiest one to complete.

Hack 2: I haven't really been able to go over object references very much so I might need to research a little bit, however I think I'll be able to figure everything out and complete it by Wednesday or Thursday.

Hack 3: This one sounds kind of difficult to navigate but the actual plan seems simple, this means I'll have to work a little bit longer on this one but I'll figure it out by Friday, if not I'll finish it by the weekend.
