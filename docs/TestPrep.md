# Test Prep
##### Week 1 Plan
Do the things that are given in class (FRQs, MCQs). Missed questions review topics, possibly look on College Board for other videos or practice that can help me with the topics that I'm confused about. Also make a document that has details on all the topics that I'm not sure about, similar to the sample study guide. Follow test days with Mr. M and base creation of study guide document around those days (eg. if the test is on Tuesday and Thursday, work on the study guide on Monday and use extra time on Wednesday and Thursday to work on it as well).

Week of 4/18
Monday: Create Plan
Tuesday: Practice MCQ 1 (2015)
Wednesday: Review, begin study guide with concepts missed on first practice, take notes on what Mr. M says about Q26
Thursday: Practice MCQ 2
Friday: repeat Wednesday
